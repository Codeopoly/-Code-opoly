\[Code]opoly is built on Express.Js with a Firestore database, and has a frontend powered by React, Redux, and Phaser. Socket.io is used to coordinate the player interactions with Phaser, while Firestore handles broadcasting updates of the player scores and game state. Beyond learning this tech stack, our team also researched other frameworks and reviewed JavaScript concepts while writing the game's multiple choice questions. \[Code]opoly is a great way to have fun with friends and reinforce your JavaScript knowledge together.
